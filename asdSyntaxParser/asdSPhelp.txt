This general purpose language parser requires that a score (text) must comply the following grammar definition:Score ::= Line ';' [<cr> Line ';']*(means that a score is a list of lines)Line ::= lineNumber , Action [, Action]*(each line has a line number, followed by a comma, followed by one or more actions, ending with a dot-comma)Action ::= Keyword [Parameter [ Parameter]*](an action is simply a symbol, <loop>, <uncleBennie>, etc. It can be followed by parameters. Note there are no commas in between)lineNumber ::= <positive integer including 0>Keyword ::= <symbol>Parameter ::= <symbol>|<float>|<integer><cr> - carriage returnOBS: Note that brackets [ ] mean that stuff inside is optional, [ ]* means that stuff inside is optional and can be repeated.So, it means you can program your own language and trigger instructions in a coll that accepts different length commands.There's no need to write each action in a line in any specific order. Moreover, you can input data from an external editor patch or by other mean.In this patch, the left inlet serves the score coll, the rigth on the syntax coll. More, the left inlet accepts the parse message (it prints each line in max window) and the help message to open this help file.Antonio de Sousa Dias
